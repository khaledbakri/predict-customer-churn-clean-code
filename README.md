# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Requirements

To install the dependencies, you need first to create an environment with python 3.8, which can be done using conda and the following command:
```bash
conda create --name clean_code_3.8 python=3.8
```

Next, run the command below to install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements_py38.txt
```
## Project Description

This project is the application of the coding best practices to refactor the notebook churn_notebook.ipynb, yielding the library called churn_library_solution.py. This solution aims to find customers who are likely to churn and it is implemented using two machine learning algorithms, which are linear regression and random forest.
